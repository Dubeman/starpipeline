> A comprehensive machine learning pipeline for automated astronomical image processing, restoration, and analysis using reinforcement learning and computer vision techniques.

## üéì Academic Context

This project is developed as part of **SWEN 614 - Engineering Self-Adaptive Cloud Software Systems**, demonstrating the application of adaptive AI systems to real-world astronomical image processing challenges. The pipeline showcases self-adaptive behavior through reinforcement learning agents that dynamically select and sequence restoration tools based on image characteristics.

## üåü Overview

StarPipeline is an advanced research project that combines multiple AI/ML techniques to create a fully automated pipeline for processing astronomical images. The system integrates reinforcement learning, computer vision, and web technologies to provide intelligent image restoration, classification, and visualization capabilities for astronomical data.

## üì∏ Results Demonstration

### RL-Restore Framework in Action

The following demonstrates the power of our adaptive CNN sequencing approach:

**Before (Noisy Input)** ‚Üí **{...sequence of CNNs applied}** ‚Üí **After (Restored Output)**

*Left: Original noisy astronomical image with synthetic degradations*  
*Right: Cleaned and enhanced image after adaptive CNN toolkit application*

The RL agent intelligently selects and sequences specialized restoration tools to achieve optimal image quality, demonstrating the self-adaptive nature of the system as it learns to handle different types of astronomical image degradations.

## üî¨ RL-Restore: Self-Adaptive Image Restoration

### Technical Implementation

**Dataset**: Generated set of astronomical images with synthetic degradations (Gaussian noise)

**States (s)**: The current corrupted or noisy image (full image or image patch), represented as a tensor or pixel array fed to the agent.

**Actions (a)**: Each action corresponds to applying a specific pre-trained CNN from a restoration toolkit. The agent learns to select and sequence these tools to create an adaptive restoration pipeline.

### Restoration Toolkit Actions:
- **Tool 1 & 2**: General-purpose CNNs for feature extraction and coarse restoration
- **Tool 3-8**: Restoration-focused CNNs with 64 filters for denoising and deblurring
- **Tool 9**: Fine-detail preservation using smaller 9√ó9 kernels
- **Tool 11 & 12**: Specialized CNNs tuned for space-based noise and distortions

The RL agent learns to adaptively select and sequence these restoration tools to maximize image quality for astronomical data, demonstrating true self-adaptive behavior as required in cloud software systems.
